Daily Learning Log - Day 1
Date: 26/05/25
What I Learned Today:
New Concepts:
HTML document structure
Key HTML tags
Importance of clean code (utilising indentation, divs, classes, etc)
CSS selectors and basic styling
Use of IDs (#) vs classes (.)

Breakthrough Moments:
Understand the technical difference between a tag and an element (had thought they were interchangeable)
Understand why some HTML tags are "void elements" (due to being self-containing)
In my previous, brief experience, I had copied CSS styling files; now understand how CSS links to HTML

Still Confused About:
Need more practice with Flexbox, and to visualise how each attribute effects layout

What I Built Today:
Files Created:
about-me.html - Basic personal webpage
style.css - Styling for webpage

Link to Code: [GitHub repository link]

Challenges Faced:

Lost time in the morning due to needing to collect new laptop.
Navigated situation by reshuffling routine to move gym till later, once day's tasks were completed.
Not 100% sure on how SEO uses elements (title, main, section, etc). Could research further.
Flexbox. Was dfficult to take in the content in the guide (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#aa-prefixing-flexbox).
Examples helped somewhat, but video showing step-by-step would be ideal. Will search to find a video.

Tomorrow's Goals:
Main Focus: JavaScript Intro
Specific Tasks:
 Refresh JavaScript basics (data types, variables, functions, etc)
 Link back to HTML
 Create mathematical functions
 Upload files to GitHub

Daily Learning Log - Day 2
Date: 27/05/25
What I Learned Today:
New Concepts:
JavaScript data types, variables, functions, if statements, etc (via book - https://javascript.info/ - and freecodecamp)
In-browser vs server-side environnents (e.g. Node.js)
Using Live Server to open HTML files (better than a preview in VS)
Alerts, buttons, DOM manipulation
Clonining repos and pushing commits to github directly from VS Code

Breakthrough Moments:
Practice with JS in Chrome dev tools
Clarified distinction between console.log and return
Retroactively understand why people would recommend both (for example) VS Code AND Sublime Text due to distinction between IDEs and "lightweight" editors
HMTL, CSS, and JavaScript separate but intertwined
Was uneccesarily using Flexbox for text-based content

Still Confused About:
Need more practice with Flexbox, and to visualise how each attribute effects layout

What I Built Today:
Files Created:
style.css - Updated for
script.js - Interactive button functionality

Link to Code: [GitHub repository link]

Challenges Faced:

Layout errors weren't visible in the preview, so only recognised them in the Live Server, and had to trouble shoot.
Wasn't sure how to add folders in github. Went down rabbit hole and figured out how to commit directly from VS Code (which also allowed to create folder)

Tomorrow's Goals:
Main Focus: JavaScript cont.
Specific Tasks:
 More JavaScript practice (arrays, objects, loops etc)
 Adding more interactive elements to about-me HTML page, tying in above concepts
 Adding comments to explain logic and functionality
 Uploading files to github and updating learning log


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Daily Learning Log - Day 3
Date: 28/05/25
What I Learned Today:
New Concepts:
JavaScript objects and arrays (https://javascript.info/array)
Loops and Array Methods (for, for...of, forEach loops)
Randomising using Math.Random alongside Math.Floor and arr length

Breakthrough Moments:
Script not being below DOM elements meant they didn't work, fixed mistake in HTML but also learnt about DOMContentLoaded JavaScript code and pros vs cons of each
Loop in practice wasn't working because I referenced a parameter for the entire array instead of a single item

Still Confused About:
Need more variety in practice with loops as it can be applied in many scenarios

What I Built Today:
Files Created:
about-me.html - updated to add interactive elements
script.js - functionality for interactive elements
style.css - updated for new buttons and sections

Link to Code: [GitHub repository link]

Challenges Faced:

wasn't sure why buttons weren't working as intended. Had to take a quick break and look at code again with a fresh perspective to realise mistake. Also benefitted from learning about alternative fix.

Tomorrow's Goals:
Main Focus: Forms
Specific Tasks:
 Add forms to webpage (address validation and error handling)
 Understand local storage
 Reviewing code
 Uploading files to github and updating learning log

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Daily Learning Log - Day 4
Date: 29/05/25
What I Learned Today:
New Concepts:
Forms (https://javascript.info/forms-controls)
input.Value, input.textContent and inpute.innerHTML
.onfocus and .onblur

Breakthrough Moments:
more practice with getElementById and addEventListener
tabindex needed for onfocus to work with some elements (e.g. divs)

Still Confused About:
n/a

What I Built Today:
Files Created:
about-me.html - updated to add form input and submission button
script.js - functionality for form (preventing refresh, checking for blanks and dupes, error/success message)
style.css - updated for new buttons messages
Tasks.txt - Tasks carried out after learning

Link to Code: [GitHub repository link]

Challenges Faced:

Difficulty with forms task after reading.
Took a long time to think through but figured it out eventually.
Worked, but was different to given solution
Didn't complete all of today's tasks

Tomorrow's Goals:
Main Focus: Forms
Specific Tasks:
 Add another form to webpage (as data validation wasn't addressed today)
 Understand local storage (not addressed today)
 Uploading files to github and updating learning log
