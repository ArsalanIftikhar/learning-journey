Daily Learning Log - Day 1
Date: 26/05/25
What I Learned Today:
New Concepts:
HTML document structure
Key HTML tags
Importance of clean code (utilising indentation, divs, classes, etc)
CSS selectors and basic styling
Use of IDs (#) vs classes (.)

Breakthrough Moments:
Understand the technical difference between a tag and an element (had thought they were interchangeable)
Understand why some HTML tags are "void elements" (due to being self-containing)
In my previous, brief experience, I had copied CSS styling files; now understand how CSS links to HTML

Still Confused About:
Need more practice with Flexbox, and to visualise how each attribute effects layout

What I Built Today:
Files Created:
about-me.html - Basic personal webpage
style.css - Styling for webpage

Link to Code: [GitHub repository link]

Challenges Faced:

Lost time in the morning due to needing to collect new laptop.
Navigated situation by reshuffling routine to move gym till later, once day's tasks were completed.
Not 100% sure on how SEO uses elements (title, main, section, etc). Could research further.
Flexbox. Was dfficult to take in the content in the guide (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#aa-prefixing-flexbox).
Examples helped somewhat, but video showing step-by-step would be ideal. Will search to find a video.

Tomorrow's Goals:
Main Focus: JavaScript Intro
Specific Tasks:
 Refresh JavaScript basics (data types, variables, functions, etc)
 Link back to HTML
 Create mathematical functions
 Upload files to GitHub
