# learning-journey

Welcome! This repository tracks my daily progress as I learn front-end web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I'm approaching this through **daily mini-projects and challenges**, with each day's work saved in its own folder.
The learning log reflects on each day's learning, breakthroughs, and difficulties.
